# Credit Card Fraud Detection
My code for the oral exam in Machine Learning and Statistics I in January 2019, at the University of Manchester.

The data on which the project is based can be collected from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud 
Note that a smaller subsample of the results presented here were used to produce these results.

Three versions of a Logistic regression model were made:
- Model 1: Simple logistic regression model
- Model 2: With feature selection
- Model 3: With feature selection and undersampling
